Go to your Windower4\addons folder. Create a new folder called "WhereIsDI". Copy the "WhereIsDI.lua" and "mireu.xml" files into that folder.

You can type "lua r whereisdi" in the Windower Console to load immediately. To load the addon everytime you log in, add "lua load WhereIsDI" to your "Windower4\scripts\init.txt" file.

This addon only works if the character using it is in Jakoh's unity.

When Mireu leaves or is defeated, this addon will update the mireu.xml file with the date and time.

This addon allows your LS members can use two new commands in LS chat:

!di
This will display the latest domain invasion information.

!mireu
This will display when the next mireu window will open or, if it is already open, how long it has been open.
